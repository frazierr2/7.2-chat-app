# 7.2  Chat App

With continued practice into React. This app is a basic chat app built with React, Heroku and Parse.


### Tech Used

During the development of this project I used the following technology:


* [HTML5] - latest version of Hypertext Markup Language, the code that describes web pages
* [CSS3] - latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [jQuery] - fast and concise Javascript Library
* [Backbone.js] - light weight Javascript library to structure applications
* [React.js] - declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces
